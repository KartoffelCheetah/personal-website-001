# personal-website-001
@KartoffelCheetah 's first website's repo.

I uploaded my first website so you can have a look at it or do what you want with it.
Feel free to use it for your own website if you like. I already added some images as placeholders.

Please not that the server is set in development mode. Not ready for production! This is intentional, because it is likely that future users will first want to develop.
**Before going into production please switch to production mode!**

### Dependencies:

- Python3 and Flask installed on your computer.
- Optionally install npm and Node.js if you wish to edit the Stylus stylesheets.
- @Deevad 's [Pepper&Carrot Fonts](https://github.com/Deevad/peppercarrot_fonts) cloned under ./static/fonts/peppercarrot_fonts.

There are two included dependencies:
- @blueimp 's [JavaScript-Load-Image](https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Load-Image)
- [JQuery-3.2.1](http://jquery.com/)

**Note:** favicons were generated by @RealFaviconGenerator 's [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
