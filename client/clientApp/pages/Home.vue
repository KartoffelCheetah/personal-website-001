	h2.kcHeading3 About me
	p.kcParagraph
		strong I start with a few words concerning my work as an FE dev.
		br
		| My base of operations is in Budapest, Hungary.
		br
		| Most of my work consists of the development of a supermarket chain's international
		| <em>e-commerce</em> &#43; administrative platforms. It involves maintaining
		| and developing the different sites running on the framework.
		| Between 2018-2021 I worked as the sole FE developer of the
		| project and since then as part of a team of (very cool) FE developers.
	p.kcParagraph
		| I&apos;m a staunch supporter of software accessibility,
		| an advocate of Open Source technologies&#47;art&#47;etc.
		| My choice of OS is Linux üêß both for work and personal use.
		| Lastly, I also dabble a bit in 2D art.
